#Tech Academy C# coursework
#A note about this repo
C # and .NET comprised the final web dev course section at The Tech Academy. 
The coursework/challenges and assignments were pushed continuously to Github and placed in their own individual repositories. Work from this course spans from 1-19-2024 through 3-20-2024. 
I wanted to preserve the timeline of git commits and the structure of the work.
Below are a few of the projects to highlight some of the skills and lessons covered.
